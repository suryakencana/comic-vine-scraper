**Comic Vine Scraper** is an add-on script for [ComicRack](http://comicrack.cyolito.com/) that lets you 'scrape' (copy) details from the [Comic Vine](http://www.comicvine.com/) database into your comic book files and into your ComicRack database.  You can use it to scrape a large amount of extra information, including titles, ratings, characters, teams, plot summaries, writers, letterers, cover artists, publication dates, and much more.
